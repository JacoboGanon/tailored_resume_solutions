## General Guidelines

### Length

- **Entry Level (0-5 years)**: 1 page maximum
- **Mid-Level (5-10 years)**: 1-2 pages
- **Senior Level (10+ years)**: 2 pages maximum

**Rule of Thumb**: Every line on your resume should add value. If it doesn't make you more hirable, remove it.

### Formatting

- **Font**: Use professional fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- **Font Size**: 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for your name
- **Margins**: 0.5-1 inch on all sides
- **Line Spacing**: 1.0-1.15 for readability
- **Alignment**: Left-aligned (easier for ATS to parse)
- **File Format**: PDF or DOCX (check job posting requirements)

### Design Principles

- **Consistency**: Use the same formatting throughout
- **White Space**: Don't cram too much information
- **Hierarchy**: Use headers, bold, and spacing to guide the eye
- **Simplicity**: Avoid tables, text boxes, headers, and footers
- **No Photos**: Unless specifically requested (common in some countries)

## Resume Structure

### 1. Header (Contact Information)

**Include:**
- Full Name (largest text on the page)
- Phone Number
- Professional Email Address
- LinkedIn Profile URL
- GitHub/Portfolio (for technical roles)
- City, State (optional, no full address needed)

**Example:**
```
JANE DOE
jane.doe@email.com | (555) 123-4567 | linkedin.com/in/janedoe | github.com/janedoe
San Francisco, CA
```

### 2. Professional Summary (Optional)

2-3 sentences highlighting:
- Years of experience
- Key expertise areas
- Notable achievements or specializations

**Example:**
```
Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable web applications.
Expert in React, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure. Led development of features
serving 10M+ users, improving performance by 40%.
```

**When to Skip**: If you're entry-level or the rest of your resume is strong enough.

### 3. Work Experience (Required)

List in **reverse chronological order** (most recent first).

**For Each Position Include:**
- Job Title
- Company Name
- Location (City, State)
- Dates (Month Year - Month Year or "Present")
- 3-5 bullet points describing achievements and responsibilities

**Format:**
```

```

### 4. Education (Required)

**Include:**
- Degree Type and Major

```

### 6. Projects (Optional, Recommended for Technical Roles)

- **Speaking**: Conference talks, workshops
- **Volunteer Work**: Relevant volunteer experience
- **Awards**: Professional recognitions

## ATS Optimization

### What is ATS?

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are software that companies use to filter and rank resumes before a human sees them. 90%+ of large companies use ATS.

### How to Beat ATS

#### 1. Use Standard Section Headings

✅ **Use These:**
- Experience / Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Certifications

❌ **Avoid These:**
- "Where I've Worked"
- "What I Know"
- "My Journey"

#### 2. Include Keywords from Job Description

**Strategy:**
1. Read the job posting carefully
2. Identify required skills, qualifications, and keywords
3. Incorporate exact phrases (if true) into your resume
4. Match the language they use (e.g., "JavaScript" vs "JS")

**Example:**
If the job says "Experience with React.js and TypeScript", use those exact terms, not "Experience with modern JavaScript frameworks".

#### 3. Use Standard Formatting

✅ **ATS-Friendly:**
- Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Simple bullet points (•, -, *)
- Clear section breaks
- Left-aligned text

❌ **ATS-Unfriendly:**
- Tables for layout
- Text boxes
- Headers and footers
- Images and graphics
- Columns (use sparingly)
- Fancy fonts

#### 4. Save in Correct Format

- **.docx** - Most compatible
- **.pdf** - Usually works, but check job posting
- **Plain text** - Safe fallback

#### 5. Spell Out Acronyms (First Use)

**Example:** "Developed RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)"

This helps ATS match both the acronym and full term.

## Writing Effective Bullet Points

### The Formula

**[Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [How You Did It] + [Result/Impact]**

### Action Verbs by Category

**Leadership:**
Led, Managed, Directed, Coordinated, Supervised, Mentored, Trained

**Achievement:**
Achieved, Delivered, Exceeded, Improved, Increased, Reduced, Optimized

**Technical:**
Developed, Engineered, Built, Implemented, Deployed, Designed, Architected

**Analysis:**
Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Researched, Investigated

**Communication:**
Presented, Communicated, Collaborated, Facilitated, Negotiated

### Use Metrics and Numbers

Numbers make your achievements concrete and impressive.

❌ **Weak:**
- "Improved website performance"
- "Worked on a large project"
- "Helped increase sales"

✅ **Strong:**
- "Improved website performance by 60% through lazy loading and code splitting"
- "Led development of e-commerce platform serving 100K+ monthly users"
- "Increased sales by 25% ($500K annual revenue) through targeted email campaigns"

### The STAR Method

**Situation** - Context and background
**Task** - Your responsibility
**Action** - What you did
**Result** - The outcome

**Example:**
"Reduced customer support tickets by 40% (Result) by designing and implementing an automated FAQ chatbot (Action) to handle common inquiries for a SaaS product with 10K+ users (Situation)"

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague:**
- "Responsible for improving code quality"
- "Worked with cross-functional teams"
- "Used modern technologies"

✅ **Specific:**
- "Established code review process and wrote style guide, reducing bug reports by 30%"
- "Collaborated with design, product, and QA teams of 15+ members using Agile methodology"
- "Built responsive web app using React, TypeScript, and GraphQL"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Using "Responsibilities" Instead of "Achievements"

❌ Don't List Duties:
- "Responsible for managing social media accounts"
- "Tasked with writing code"

✅ Show Impact:
- "Grew Instagram following from 5K to 50K in 6 months through targeted content strategy"
- "Developed 15+ features resulting in 20% increase in user engagement"

### 2. Including Irrelevant Information

**Remove:**
- Outdated skills (e.g., MS Office for tech roles)
- High school information (if you have a degree)
- Personal hobbies (unless directly relevant)
- References ("available upon request" is unnecessary)
- Full address (city/state is enough)

### 3. Using Personal Pronouns

❌ "I developed a web application..."
✅ "Developed a web application..."

### 4. Typos and Grammar Errors

- Use spell check
- Read your resume aloud
- Have someone else proofread
- Use tools like Grammarly

### 5. Lying or Exaggerating

**Never:**
- Fabricate experience
- Inflate numbers significantly
- Claim skills you don't have
- Add fake education credentials

**Do:**
- Be honest about experience level
- Use ranges for uncertain metrics ("Improved performance by 40-60%")
- Acknowledge team contributions ("Collaborated on..." vs "Single-handedly...")

### 6. Using a Generic Resume

**Customize each resume:**
- Adjust summary for the role
- Highlight relevant experiences
- Match keywords from job posting
- Reorder bullet points by relevance

## Industry-Specific Tips
